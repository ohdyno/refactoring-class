## Progress
In the middle of naming

## Feedback
Stricter facilitation on navigator/driver because group is talkative and makes driving difficult.

More focus on the task at hand (removing clutter, renaming)

Facilitator needs to remind group to 'listen to the code' more in order to be informed of a better name
